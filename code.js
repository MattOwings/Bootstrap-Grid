// DOM to emphasize a click on one of the example-elements
// Will do soon

// Plans:
// If you click one of the example elements it switches color and does a simple animation
// purpose: the idea is for the elements to be easy to read and easy to click 
// no matter what your screen size is, therefore showing emphasis for a click is
// important to display.
